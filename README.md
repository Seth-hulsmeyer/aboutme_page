# aboutme_page

This is my coding portfolio. It will evolve as my skills in full stack coding improve.

The navbar on every page is reactive to the view portal's size.

On the About Me page (index.html) you will find personal information about me and some ideas for this portfolio.

The website is responsive to the smaller screens and works on mobile devices as well.

The footer now has links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles, as well as a link to my resume which can be downloaded
