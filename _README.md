# aboutme_page

This is the start to my coding portfolio. It will evolve as my skills in full stack coding improve.

In its current state, it examplifies my ability to code with Bootstrap elements, while spacing with rows and columns. You can also see reactive images and elements throughout the website.

The navbar on every page is reactive to the view portal's size.

On the About Me page (index.html) you will find personal information about me and some ideas for this portfolio.

On the Contact page (contact.html) you will find a form for users to enter in their contact information, as well as some of my contact information.

On the Portfolio page (portfolio.html) you will find personal pictures for now, but in the future there will be link to future projects that I will complete.
